<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-Cylinder Road Rollers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tamp Drum</li><li>Smooth Drum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-cylinder road rollers are essential in construction and road maintenance, primarily available in two types: tamp drum and smooth drum. Tamp drum rollers are equipped with protrusions that compact the surface more effectively, making them ideal for granular soils and cohesive materials. Conversely, smooth drum rollers feature a flat, featureless surface, which provides uniform compaction and is best suited for asphalt and finished surfaces. Both types contribute significantly to achieving desired compaction levels, enhancing road durability and stability.</p></p>
