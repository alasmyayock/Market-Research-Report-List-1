<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Liquid Cooling Radiator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Liquid Cooling Radiator</li><li>Direct Liquid Cooling Radiator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The server liquid cooling radiator market encompasses two primary types: traditional liquid cooling radiators and direct liquid cooling radiators. Traditional liquid cooling radiators use a closed-loop system to dissipate heat through a coolant that circulates between the server components and an external radiator. In contrast, direct liquid cooling radiators involve coolant flowing directly over the components, providing efficient heat absorption and minimizing thermal resistance. Both systems enhance server performance and reliability, addressing the increasing thermal demands of modern computing environments.</p></p>
